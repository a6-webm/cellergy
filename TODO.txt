TODO might remove .gitattributes making assets into binary files, cause u don't need those sitting on github I don't think idk

TODO implement fields being calculated and a cell system of this:
    - maybe split the number line into different elements
    - e.g. 0-100 neutral, 100-1000 heat, 1000-10000 ice, etc
    - have each cell want to tend towards a point in their energy range (e.g. all neutral energy wants to tend towards 30)
    - energy moves one tile in the direction of a field?


TODONE implement Conway's game of life to test stuff


Notes:
Fields like a gravitational field are a no go, they take waaaaay too long to calculate

Terraria small worlds are 1200w x 4200h, so first test would be one cell per block, and if that goes super well, 4 cells per block, etc
