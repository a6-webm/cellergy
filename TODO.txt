TODO might remove .gitattributes making assets into binary files, cause u don't need those sitting on github I don't think idk

TODO there was an error building, something about GLOB lol
TODO make sure cellUniverse.cpp is acting as the MODEL
TODO implement a view/render file that draws everything to the screen, acting as the VIEW
TODO implement a player file as a CONTROLLER that passes camera and status data to the VIEW

TODONE implement Conway's game of life to test stuff


Notes:
basically a factorio-like (start from nothing, use resources to make new resources, towards some final goal resource)
but, the whole world is a cellular automata universe
and you are a cell that can move with wasd
and ambling about everywhere are dumb cells (move randomly, benign)
and your player character can modify cells to have different behaviours, e.g. attract to other cells, move away from other cells, conway's game of life, etc

Fields like a gravitational field are a no go, they take waaaaay too long to calculate

Terraria small worlds are 1200w x 4200h, so first test would be one cell per block, and if that goes super well, 4 cells per block, etc
